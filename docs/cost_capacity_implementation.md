# Cost and Capacity Monitoring Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the cost and capacity monitoring implementation for LedgerLens, delivered as part of the observability enhancement initiative.

## Overview

This implementation adds comprehensive cost visibility and capacity planning to LedgerLens's existing observability stack. It translates Kubernetes resource consumption into financial metrics and provides forward-looking capacity projections to answer:

- **What does LedgerLens cost to run?** (per hour, per wallet scored, per pod)
- **How much will it cost next month?** (trend analysis)
- **When will we run out of capacity?** (days until maxReplicas or PVC full)

## What Was Added

### Configuration

1. **`.env.example`** — Added 5 new environment variables for cost and capacity configuration:
   - `COST_PER_VCPU_HOUR_USD`
   - `COST_PER_GB_MEMORY_HOUR_USD`
   - `COST_PER_GB_STORAGE_MONTH_USD`
   - `CAPACITY_PROJECTION_WINDOW_DAYS`
   - `CAPACITY_PROJECTION_LEAD_TIME_DAYS`

2. **`config/settings.py`** — Added configuration fields with validation:
   - Cost coefficients must be non-negative
   - Capacity projection days must be >= 1
   - Follows existing pydantic-settings pattern

3. **`config/cost_exporter.py`** — NEW: Lightweight exporter that exposes cost coefficients as Prometheus gauges:
   - `ledgerlens_cost_per_vcpu_hour_usd`
   - `ledgerlens_cost_per_gb_memory_hour_usd`
   - `ledgerlens_cost_per_gb_storage_month_usd`
   - Initialized at application startup in `api/main.py`

### Prometheus Monitoring

1. **`monitoring/recording_rules_cost.yml`** — NEW: Recording rules for cost and capacity metrics:
   - **Cost metrics:**
     - `ledgerlens:pod_cost_per_hour:usd` — Per-pod cost (CPU + memory)
     - `ledgerlens:namespace_cost_per_hour:usd` — Total namespace cost
     - `ledgerlens:cost_per_wallet_scored:usd` — Unit economics
     - `ledgerlens:storage_cost_per_hour:usd` — PVC cost
   - **Capacity metrics:**
     - `ledgerlens:replica_count_projected_days_to_max` — Days until maxReplicas

### Helm Chart

1. **`helm/ledgerlens/templates/cost-config.yaml`** — NEW: ConfigMap template for cost configuration

2. **`helm/ledgerlens/values.yaml`** — Added `costConfig` section:
   ```yaml
   costConfig:
     enabled: true
     costPerVcpuHourUsd: "0.0416"
     costPerGbMemoryHourUsd: "0.0056"
     costPerGbStorageMonthUsd: "0.10"
     capacityProjectionWindowDays: "7"
     capacityProjectionLeadTimeDays: "14"
   ```

3. **`helm/ledgerlens/templates/api-deployment.yaml`** — Updated to include cost-config ConfigMap in `envFrom`

### Documentation

1. **`docs/cost_and_capacity.md`** — NEW: 500+ line comprehensive guide covering:

   - Cost model explanation and coefficient configuration
   - Capacity projection methodology (predict_linear/deriv)
   - CapacityLimitApproaching alert runbook
   - Grafana dashboard panel descriptions
   - Prerequisites (kube-state-metrics, cadvisor)
   - Cost exporter implementation details
   - Helm deployment instructions
   - Limitations and caveats
   - Security considerations (cost coefficient confidentiality)
   - Troubleshooting guide

2. **`docs/observability.md`** — Updated to reference cost and capacity features

3. **`docs/metrics.md`** — Updated to reference cost recording rules

4. **`docs/kubernetes_deployment.md`** — Updated to document cost configuration in Helm chart

### Tests

1. **`tests/test_cost_metrics.py`** — NEW: Unit tests for cost exporter:
   - Test gauge initialization from settings
   - Test idempotency (repeated calls are no-ops)
   - Test metrics endpoint exposure
   - Test default values are reasonable
   - Test validation rejects negative coefficients
   - Test capacity projection configuration validation

### CI/CD

1. **`.github/workflows/cost-monitoring-validation.yml`** — NEW: GitHub Actions workflow that validates:
   - Prometheus recording rules syntax (with `promtool`)
   - Alert rules syntax
   - Grafana dashboard JSON schema
   - Required dashboard panels exist
   - Dashboard references correct metrics
   - Cost metrics unit tests pass

## How It Works

### Cost Model

1. **Configuration:** Operator sets cost coefficients in `.env` or Helm values (defaults to approximate on-demand pricing)

2. **Exporter:** At startup, `config/cost_exporter.py` sets three Prometheus gauges from `settings.py`

3. **Recording rules:** Prometheus multiplies kube-state-metrics/cadvisor resource usage by cost gauges to produce cost-per-pod, cost-per-namespace, and cost-per-wallet metrics

4. **Dashboard:** Grafana visualizes cost metrics over time

### Capacity Projection

1. **Recording rules:** Use Prometheus `deriv()` and `predict_linear()` to extrapolate current growth trends:
   - Compute growth rate over 7 days (configurable)
   - Calculate days remaining until maxReplicas or PVC full
   - Project future wallet scoring throughput

2. **Alert:** `CapacityLimitApproaching` fires when projected exhaustion is within 14 days (configurable)

3. **Dashboard:** Gauges display days-to-limit with color-coded thresholds (red < 7, orange 7-14, yellow 14-30, green > 30)

## Security Considerations

### Cost Coefficient Confidentiality

Negotiated cloud discount rates are commercially sensitive. The implementation:

- Uses default (on-demand) values in committed `values.yaml`
- Documents that production pricing should be overridden via `--set` or private values overlay
- Warns in comments not to commit actual negotiated rates to public repositories

### Dashboard Access Control

The cost dashboard exposes operational intelligence (replica counts, scoring rates). Documentation recommends:

- Enable Grafana authentication (disable anonymous access)
- Use Grafana RBAC to restrict dashboard access
- Do not expose Grafana publicly without authentication

### No PII in Metrics

Cost and capacity metrics aggregate resource consumption only. No wallet addresses, API keys, or transaction hashes appear in metric labels (consistent with existing metrics security policy).

## Prerequisites

The cost and capacity features require:

1. **kube-state-metrics** — for replica counts, PVC sizes, deployment status (included in most K8s distributions)

2. **cadvisor** — for CPU/memory usage (included in kubelet, no separate install needed)

3. **Prometheus** — scraping both LedgerLens `/metrics` endpoint and kube-state-metrics

4. **Grafana** — for dashboard visualization (optional but recommended)

## Testing

Validation is performed at multiple levels:

1. **Unit tests:** `tests/test_cost_metrics.py` verifies gauge initialization and configuration validation

2. **YAML validation:** CI validates Prometheus rules and Grafana dashboard JSON with `promtool` and `jq`

3. **Manual verification:** Documentation includes manual verification steps for staging:
   - Confirm cost metrics are exposed at `/metrics`
   - Verify recording rules appear in Prometheus
   - Check capacity projection produces sane values (non-Inf, non-NaN)
   - Test alert fires correctly against synthetic replica growth

## Deployment

### Local Development

```bash
# 1. Set cost coefficients in .env
echo "COST_PER_VCPU_HOUR_USD=0.0416" >> .env
echo "COST_PER_GB_MEMORY_HOUR_USD=0.0056" >> .env
echo "COST_PER_GB_STORAGE_MONTH_USD=0.10" >> .env

# 2. Start the API (cost metrics initialize at startup)
uvicorn api.main:app --reload

# 3. Verify cost gauges are exposed
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics | grep ledgerlens_cost_per
```

### Kubernetes / Helm

```bash
# 1. Update values.yaml with your cloud pricing
# Or use --set overrides for sensitive values

# 2. Install/upgrade
helm upgrade --install ledgerlens ./helm/ledgerlens \
  --set costConfig.costPerVcpuHourUsd=0.0416

# 3. Load Prometheus rules
kubectl apply -f monitoring/recording_rules_cost.yml
kubectl apply -f monitoring/alerts.yml

# 4. Import Grafana dashboard
# Upload monitoring/grafana/cost_capacity_dashboard.json via Grafana UI
# Or provision via monitoring/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/ledgerlens.yaml
```

2. **Calibrate cost coefficients:** Replace defaults with actual cloud pricing

3. **Tune projection window:** Adjust `CAPACITY_PROJECTION_WINDOW_DAYS` based on traffic pattern stability

4. **Extend alerting:** Consider additional alerts for cost anomalies (e.g., cost-per-wallet > threshold)

5. **Add more panels:** Future dashboard enhancements could include:
   - Month-over-month cost comparison
   - Cost breakdown by component (API vs worker)
   - Budget tracking (actual vs planned spend)
