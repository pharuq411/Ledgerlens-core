# LedgerLens Core

LedgerLens is a Benford's Law + ensemble ML wash-trading detection engine for the Stellar DEX.

## What it does

LedgerLens ingests real-time trade data from the Stellar Horizon API and scores wallet/asset-pair
combinations for wash-trading risk using a multi-layer detection pipeline:

- **Benford's Law analysis** — statistical digit-distribution tests on trade amounts
- **Ensemble ML** — Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM ensemble scoring
- **Graph analysis** — wash-trading ring detection via network graph algorithms
- **Cross-chain detection** — EVM bridge transfer correlation
- **Temporal modeling** — LSTM-based temporal risk adjustment
- **Conformal prediction** — calibrated uncertainty bands on scores

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate synthetic training data and train models
make generate-data
make train

# Start the local API
make serve
```

The API is then available at `http://localhost:8000`. See the [REST API reference](api_reference.md)
for all available endpoints.

## Architecture

```

                              Detection Engine (Benford + ML + Graph)
                                        ↓
                              Risk Score (0–100) → API + Webhooks
                                        ↓
