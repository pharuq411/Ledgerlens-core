"""Soroban contract client with uncertainty-aware score submission.

Extends the existing ``SorobanPublisher`` (in ``detection.soroban_publisher``)
with a ``submit_score_with_uncertainty`` method that passes ``score_lower``
and ``score_upper`` as additional Soroban ``i128`` fields (scaled ×100 for
integer representation).

    Parameters
    ----------
    publisher:
        Initialized ``SorobanPublisher`` instance.
    risk_score:
        ``RiskScore`` instance containing score, wallet, asset_pair,
        and optional uncertainty fields (``score_lower``, ``score_upper``).
    dry_run:
        If True, log the submission but do not send it on-chain.

        Accept a plain ``submit_score`` that drops ``score_lower``/
        ``score_upper`` while the contract-side function is unavailable. The
        downgrade is logged at WARNING, naming the bounds that were dropped.

    -------
    Transaction hash on success, ``None`` on skip (``dry_run=True``).

    Raises
    ------
    SorobanSubmissionError
        On unrecoverable submission failure.
    SorobanCircuitOpenError
        When the circuit breaker is open.
    UncertaintyBoundsUnsupportedError
        When the contract cannot store uncertainty bounds and the caller has
        not opted into a downgraded submission via ``allow_downgrade``.
