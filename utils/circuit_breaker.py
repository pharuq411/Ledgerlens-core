"""A small, dependency-free circuit breaker for external calls.

Used to wrap calls to the Stellar Horizon API (`ingestion.horizon_streamer`)
and the Redis feature store (`detection.feature_store`) so that a sustained
outage in either trips a breaker that fast-fails subsequent calls instead of
retrying indefinitely and exhausting connection pools / threads.

State machine
-------------
CLOSED     -- normal operation. Failures are counted; reaching
              `failure_threshold` consecutive failures opens the circuit.
OPEN       -- calls are rejected immediately (`CircuitOpenError`) without
              attempting the underlying operation, until `recovery_timeout`
              seconds have elapsed.
HALF_OPEN  -- entered automatically once `recovery_timeout` has elapsed
              while OPEN. Exactly one probe call is allowed through: success
              closes the circuit, failure re-opens it (and resets the
              recovery timer).
