"""Participant admission control for the federated aggregation server.

Root cause this addresses: `FederatedAggregationServer.register_participant`
previously accepted *any* participant_id with a freshly-generated Ed25519 key
and no authorization step — any actor able to reach the registration endpoint
could mint an unlimited number of participant identities (Sybil), and once
registered, the server trusted a fully self-reported ``n_samples`` value with
no cap, which directly and proportionally controls FedAvg aggregation weight.

This module decouples registration from open self-service: a participant_id
must be explicitly *admitted* by an operator — out-of-band, via
:func:`admit_participant` (exposed through ``cli.py federated admit`` and the
admin-gated ``POST /v1/admin/federated/admit-participant`` endpoint) — before
:meth:`FederatedAggregationServer.register_participant` will accept a key for
it. Admission also assigns a ``max_n_samples`` ceiling: the largest sample
count the server will ever credit that participant for, regardless of what
it claims in a signed update payload (see ``server.py``'s
``_effective_n_samples``). This is the operator's out-of-band judgement call
(e.g. based on the institution's known transaction volume) standing in for a
verifiable dataset-size attestation -- see docs/federated_learning.md's
"Participant Admission & Weight Bounding" section for the full threat model
and why this was chosen over a ZK range proof or TEE attestation.

Storage mirrors ``detection.federated.audit``'s self-contained SQLite
pattern: a dedicated table, a `db_path` override for tests, module-level
functions rather than a class (this store has no in-memory state to manage
between calls, unlike the server itself).
